# SourceTaxisSimulator


**Description** 
 Simulation tool that explores embodiment and sensory perception of a software agent in the context of odour source localization. The software simulates navigation trajectories given sensorimotor connections and embodiment of an insect-like agent in a chemical environment. STS allows easy customisation and scalability to other sensory modalities and animal embodiments. Analysis of the trajectories provides insights about insect navigation strategies as well as the role of active perception and the neurophysiological mechanisms of animal behaviour. Applying this software in a case study, we explored the neural processing in the ON/OFF olfactory receptor neurons in the American cockroach via Braitenberg vehicles and its performance in olfactory navigation.
